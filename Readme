# ELTA – Data Analyst Home Task

## Project Overview

This repository presents my complete solution to the **ELTA Data Analyst Home Task**, designed to showcase strong analytical thinking, structured problem-solving, and the ability to extract meaningful business insights from raw data.

Throughout this project I demonstrate the full analytical workflow — from raw data to actionable conclusions.


- **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
  Understanding the dataset, handling missing values, fixing inconsistencies and preparing the data for analysis.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Creating new meaningful features that improve analytical depth and business relevance.

- **Analytical Reasoning**  
  Applying statistical thinking to identify trends, patterns and anomalies.

- **Business Insights**  
  Translating numbers into clear insights that can support real decision-making.

All analysis was performed using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**, following clean, readable and reproducible practices.
